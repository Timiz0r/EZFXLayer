    we check for BuildingInsideVisualStudio here because of omnisharp for instance. it has problems because:
    * it may not exist (and won't get built by omnisharp of course)
    * can't find dependent .net assemblies

    for VS, this should also be fine. VS should keep track of the warnings just fine. so does omnisharp, for that
    matter; however, command-line builds are still needed, unlike VS.
